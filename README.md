# Hands-On Deep Learning - ETH Zürich

This repository holds the Jupyter Notebooks for the Hands-On Deep Learning (except the first one, which is just an introduction) lecture at ETH Zürich. 

Most of the code in the notebooks were already given to us in the lecture, except at the **exercises** or the **challenges**.

At the challenge sections you will find my approach on solving the tasks for each notebook.
